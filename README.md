## Code Style

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org) and [prettier](https://prettier.io) for linting and formatting JavaScript code. <br>

By default, all the linters run in pre-commit hooks to ensure that code is following the expected style guidelines <br>
before it is committed.

The following scripts are included: <br>

- `npm run lint`: Runs the linting tools and outputs and violations to the console
- `npm run lint:fix`: Same as above, but will attempt to fix any violations. Note <br>
  that eslint cannot fix some errors. Any errors that are not fixed will be displayed <br>
  in the console.
